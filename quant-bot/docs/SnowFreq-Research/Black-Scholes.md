This formula is an expression for the price of a European call option at time \( t \), denoted as \( C(s, K, t, T) \), where:

- \( s \) is the current stock price at time \( t \),
- \( K \) is the strike price of the option,
- \( t \) is the current time,
- \( T \) is the maturity time of the option,
- \( r \) is the risk-free interest rate,
- \( S_T \) is the stock price at maturity \( T \),
- \( f(s'|s) \) is the probability density function of the stock price at maturity given that the current price is \( s \),
- \( (x)^+ \) denotes the positive part of \( x \), i.e., \( (x)^+ = \max(x, 0) \).

### Breakdown of the Three Stages:

1. **Risk-Neutral Expectation (First Line)**:
   \[
   C(s, K, t, T) = e^{-r(T-t)} \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[ (S_T - K)^+ \bigg| S_t = s \right]
   \]
   - The formula starts with the **expected payoff** of the European call option under the **risk-neutral measure** \( \mathbb{Q} \).
   - \( (S_T - K)^+ \) is the payoff of the call option at maturity: if \( S_T \) (the stock price at maturity) is greater than the strike price \( K \), the payoff is \( S_T - K \); otherwise, itâ€™s 0.
   - The expectation \( \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}[\cdot | S_t = s] \) is the expected value under the risk-neutral probability distribution of \( S_T \), given that the current stock price is \( s \).
   - The factor \( e^{-r(T-t)} \) discounts the expected payoff back to the present value at time \( t \), using the risk-free interest rate \( r \).

2. **Integral Form (Second Line)**:
   \[
   C(s, K, t, T) = e^{-r(T-t)} \int_0^{\infty} (s' - K)^+ f(s'|s) \, ds'
   \]
   - This expresses the **expected payoff** as an **integral** over all possible values of the stock price \( S_T = s' \) at maturity \( T \), given the current stock price \( S_t = s \).
   - The term \( f(s'|s) \) represents the **conditional probability density function** of the future stock price \( s' \), given the current stock price \( s \).
   - The payoff \( (s' - K)^+ \) is 0 if \( s' \leq K \), and \( s' - K \) if \( s' > K \). So, the integral computes the average payoff, weighted by the probability density function \( f(s'|s) \).
   - Again, the result is discounted by \( e^{-r(T-t)} \) to give the present value.

3. **Simplified Integral (Third Line)**:
   \[
   C(s, K, t, T) = e^{-r(T-t)} \int_K^{\infty} (s' - K) f(s'|s) \, ds'
   \]
   - This final form simplifies the integral by noting that the payoff \( (s' - K)^+ = 0 \) for \( s' \leq K \), so the integral can be limited to the range \( s' \geq K \).
   - This is more efficient, as you only need to integrate over the values of \( s' \) that contribute to the payoff (i.e., those where \( s' > K \)).

### Summary of the Stages:

1. **First line** expresses the call price as the expected payoff discounted to the present under the risk-neutral measure.
2. **Second line** rewrites the expectation as an integral over all possible values of \( S_T \), using the conditional probability density \( f(s'|s) \).
3. **Third line** simplifies the integral by noting that the payoff is nonzero only for \( s' \geq K \), reducing the integration limits.

These three stages together provide a formula for pricing a European call option, relying on the distribution of future stock prices under the risk-neutral measure.

In the first stage of the formula:

\[
C(s, K, t, T) = e^{-r(T-t)} \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[ (S_T - K)^+ \bigg| S_t = s \right]
\]

the **long vertical line** \( \bigg| \) represents a **conditioning** or **conditional expectation**. Specifically, it indicates that the expectation is taken **conditional on the information** that the stock price at time \( t \) is equal to \( s \), i.e., \( S_t = s \).

### Interpretation:
- The expression \( \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[ (S_T - K)^+ \bigg| S_t = s \right] \) denotes the expected payoff of the call option, but the expectation is computed **given the current stock price** \( S_t = s \), under the risk-neutral measure \( \mathbb{Q} \).
- This means that, when evaluating the expected payoff, we assume that at time \( t \), the stock price is known to be \( s \), and we compute the expected value of the payoff \( (S_T - K)^+ \) at maturity \( T \), based on this assumption.

### In Summary:
- The **long vertical line** \( | \) in this formula represents **conditioning on the current state** of the stock price \( S_t = s \).
- This is crucial in the context of option pricing because we need to compute the expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure, given the current state of the asset price.
