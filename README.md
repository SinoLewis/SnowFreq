# SnowFreq Project

## Overview

SnowFreq is a comprehensive project designed to integrate advanced analytical indicators, AI-driven models, and quantitative techniques to enhance trading strategies and portfolio management. The project is divided into three main components: **Analyst Indicators**, **Trader Bot**, and **Performance Engineering**. Each component is meticulously crafted to provide a robust framework for financial analysis, trading automation, and performance optimization.

## Components

### 1. Analyst Indicators

The **Analyst Indicators** component is the core of SnowFreq, providing a wide array of tools for market analysis. It is further divided into **Technical**, **AI**, and **Quantitative** sub-components.

#### Technical Indicators

- **Oscillators**: Tools like RSI, MACD, and Stochastic Oscillators to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
- **Overlays Crossovers**: Indicators such as Moving Averages (MA) and Bollinger Bands to identify trend directions and potential reversals.
- **Buffett Indicator (Mkt Cap to GDP)**: A macroeconomic indicator comparing the total market capitalization to GDP, applied to the top 4 global indices.

#### AI-Driven Models

- **Params Initialization**: Frequency-based models initialize parameters for predictive accuracy.
- **Predictions & Training**: Utilizes frequency-based models like CNNs and Tensors for training and predictions.
- **Regressors & Classifiers**: Employs advanced algorithms such as Prophet, Catboost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and RandomForest for regression and classification tasks.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Includes FreqRL and SnowRL for adaptive learning and strategy optimization.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes market sentiment to gauge investor behavior.
- **(Un)supervised Models**: Uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for pattern recognition and prediction.
- **Auxiliary Algorithms**: K-Means clustering for data segmentation and pattern identification.
- **Freqtrade Integration**: Combines BaseFreq-Model and HighLevel-Model with Strategy and Configuration APIs for seamless trading strategy implementation.
- **Data Sampling Plan**: Structured approach for training and testing analyst indicators to ensure model robustness.

#### Quantitative Techniques

- **Pricing Derivatives**: Advanced models for pricing financial derivatives.
- **Risk Metrics & Models**: Tools for assessing and managing financial risk.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Techniques to optimize asset allocation for maximum returns with minimized risk.

### 2. Trader Bot

The **Trader Bot** component automates trading strategies by integrating the analytical capabilities of the Analyst Indicators with AI models.

- **Bot Setup**: Configuration files and AI models are used to set up the trading bot.
- **Analyst Integration**: The bot leverages the analytical insights generated by the Analyst Indicators to execute trades.

### 3. Performance Engineering

The **Performance Engineering** component ensures the system operates efficiently and effectively.

- **Monitor Metrics**: Utilizes the Locust package for system resource metrics, focusing on Big O notation for performance analysis.
- **Model Performance**: Evaluates the performance of different models based on their specific tasks.
- **Analyst Execution Params**: Tracks and analyzes the execution parameters and results of the Analyst Indicators.
- **Conclusion and Discussion**: Provides a comprehensive analysis of the results, offering insights and recommendations for future improvements.

## Example Usage

### Setting Up the Trader Bot

1. **Configuration**: Edit the `conf.yml` file to set up your trading parameters.
    ```yaml
    trading_pair: BTC/USD
    strategy: FreqRL
    risk_tolerance: medium
    ```

2. **Integration**: Ensure the Analyst Indicators are correctly integrated by running the initialization script.
    ```bash
    python initialize_analyst.py
    ```

3. **Execution**: Start the Trader Bot with the configured settings.
    ```bash
    python trader_bot.py
    ```

### Monitoring Performance

Use the Locust package to monitor system performance and resource utilization.
```bash
locust -f performance_monitor.py
```

## Conclusion

SnowFreq is a powerful tool for traders and analysts, combining advanced technical indicators, AI models, and quantitative techniques to optimize trading strategies and portfolio management. By integrating these components into a cohesive system, SnowFreq provides a robust framework for achieving superior financial performance.
